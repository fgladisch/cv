# CV

My personal CV, powered by [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).

TODO: Include Redux for better i18n state management.

**Note**: My personal information is excluded from this repository. However, you can rename `src/_personal.json` to `src/personal.json` for dummy data.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
